# How to use the i18n Memsource skill (nmstate-console-plugin)

This guide is for teammates who need to send new UI strings to Phrase/Memsource
or pull finished translations back into the repo.

This PR keeps the existing `i18n-scripts/` + `i18next-parser` setup as an
**interim** workflow. A follow-up should migrate to
[`i18next-cli`](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-cli) (and optionally
[`ocp-plugin-i18n-scripts`](https://github.com/avivtur/ocp-plugin-i18n-scripts) /
native Phrase [i18next JSON](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/7278275219612--JSON-i18next-i18nextV4-Strings)),
which can drop most custom scripts including PO conversion and
`clear-english-msgstr.js`.

## What this skill does

In Cursor, attach or invoke the **i18n-memsource** skill, then ask for one of:

| You say… | Skill runs… |
|----------|-------------|
| "upload translations" / "memsource upload" | Extract keys → build POs (keeping existing translations) → upload to Phrase |
| "download translations" / "memsource download" | Pull finished translations → convert to locale JSON → commit → optional PR |
| "translation status" / "memsource status" | Show Phrase job status per language |

State (last sprint, version, project ID) is stored in
[`.cursor/skills/i18n-memsource/state.json`](./state.json).

---

## One-time setup (your machine)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openshift/nmstate-console-plugin.git
cd nmstate-console-plugin
npm install
```

### 2. Install Memsource CLI

```bash
DIRECTORY="${HOME}/git/memsource-cli-client/"
mkdir -p "$DIRECTORY" && cd "$DIRECTORY"
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .memsource
source .memsource/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools pbr memsource-cli
```

Also install `jq` if missing: `brew install jq`.

### 3. Memsource credentials (keep out of the agent)

Create `~/.memsourcerc` for **your own shell only** (chmod 600):

```bash
source ${HOME}/git/memsource-cli-client/.memsource/bin/activate
export MEMSOURCE_URL="https://cloud.memsource.com/web"
export MEMSOURCE_USERNAME=<your-username>
export MEMSOURCE_PASSWORD="<your-password>"
```

**Security:** Do **not** give Memsource username/password (or a long-lived token)
to the Cursor agent. Treat Phrase like any other paid external service.

Recommended split:

1. **You** authenticate in a local terminal and run all `memsource-*` /
   upload-download / job-list commands there.
2. The agent may help with extract/export/validation (`npm run i18n`,
   `export-pos`, PO checks) and drafting notifications — without reading
   `~/.memsourcerc`.

**Do not** export `MEMSOURCE_TOKEN` into an agent-controlled shell. The agent
can read process environment variables; keep credentials in your terminal only.

---

## Upload flow (send strings for translation)

### Using Cursor (recommended for extract/validate)

1. Open this repo in Cursor.
2. Attach the **i18n-memsource** skill.
3. Ask the agent to extract keys and prepare validation. Provide the **OCP VERSION**
   when asked (sprint auto-increments from `state.json`).
4. **Important:** symlink creation, `export-pos`, validation, and
   `memsource-upload` must run in **one continuous authenticated shell** so the
   `locales/zh-cn` → `zh` mapping stays present when upload re-runs `export-pos`
   (the script now fails closed without it). Prefer running the whole block from
   “Manual upload” below in your terminal.
5. Review the locale diff and PO validation summary before approving upload.
6. Update `state.json` after a successful upload (or ask the agent to, using the
   project ID from the upload output — not credentials).

### Manual upload (authenticated shell)

```bash
cd nmstate-console-plugin

# Auth in YOUR terminal only — do not paste password/token into Cursor chat
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
# or: source "$HOME/git/memsource-cli-client/.memsource/bin/activate"
source ~/.memsourcerc
export MEMSOURCE_TOKEN=$(memsource auth login \
  --user-name "$MEMSOURCE_USERNAME" \
  --password "$MEMSOURCE_PASSWORD" \
  -f json \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])")
# Without MEMSOURCE_TOKEN, later commands fail with 401 "auth: not logged"
memsource auth whoami

npm run i18n
git diff --stat -- locales/   # review before continuing

# CRITICAL: without this, Chinese existing translations are lost on upload
ln -sfn zh locales/zh-cn
trap 'rm -f locales/zh-cn; rm -rf po-files locales/tmp' EXIT

rm -rf po-files
npm run export-pos
# export-pos also runs clear-english-msgstr.js so msgstr==msgid becomes empty
# validate: translated vs needs_translation; english_leaks_remaining must be 0
set -euo pipefail
for lang in ja zh-cn ko fr es; do
  echo "=== $lang ==="
  python3 -c "
import re, glob, sys
files = glob.glob(f'po-files/{sys.argv[1]}/*.po')
if not files:
  raise SystemExit(f'missing PO files for {sys.argv[1]}')
content = ''.join(open(f).read() for f in files)
entries = re.findall(r'msgid \"((?:\\\\.|[^\"])*)\"\s*msgstr \"((?:\\\\.|[^\"])*)\"', content)
entries = [(a,b) for a,b in entries if a]
translated = sum(1 for a,b in entries if b and b != a)
needs = sum(1 for a,b in entries if not b)
leaks = sum(1 for a,b in entries if b and b == a)
print(f'total={len(entries)} translated={translated} needs_translation={needs} english_leaks_remaining={leaks}')
if leaks:
  raise SystemExit('english_leaks_remaining must be 0')
" "$lang"
done

VERSION=5.0.0   # set from release / ask user
SPRINT=1        # previous state.sprint + 1
npm run memsource-upload -- -v "$VERSION" -s "$SPRINT"
# capture PROJECT_ID from memsource project create output (.uid)
```

After a successful upload, update `.cursor/skills/i18n-memsource/state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "VERSION",
  "sprint": 1,
  "lastProjectId": "PROJECT_ID",
  "memsourceProjectUrl": "https://cloud.memsource.com/web/project2/show/PROJECT_ID",
  "history": [
    {
      "version": "VERSION",
      "sprint": 1,
      "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
      "branch": "BRANCH",
      "uploadedAt": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "totalKeys": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why the `zh-cn` symlink matters

- Memsource language code: `zh-cn`
- Repo locale directory: `locales/zh/`

`i18n-to-po` looks for `locales/zh-cn/` when building Chinese POs. If that path
is missing, **all Chinese msgstr values are empty** and prior translations are
not carried forward. Create `locales/zh-cn` → `zh` before export and remove it
afterward (use a shell `trap` so cleanup runs even on failure). Download already
remaps `zh-cn` → `zh`.

---

## How existing translations are preserved

PO export does **not** upload English into every language blindly. For each language:

1. Take English keys as the source of truth (`msgid`)
2. Clear values
3. Copy back any existing translation from `locales/<lang>/plugin__nmstate-console-plugin.json` into `msgstr`
4. Leave new keys with empty `msgstr` for translators
5. **Post-export clear:** if `msgstr` still equals `msgid` (English placeholder left by `i18next-parser`), clear it to empty so Phrase marks it as needing translation

| Locale JSON value | msgstr uploaded to Phrase |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Real translation (e.g. Japanese) | Kept |
| Empty | Empty (needs translation) |
| English placeholder | Cleared to empty (needs translation) |

That is why you must run `npm run export-pos` (never hand-edit English-only POs).

With a modern Phrase + i18next JSON workflow, PO conversion and this clear step
can go away (see migration note at the top).

## Download flow (pull finished translations)

### Using Cursor

1. Attach **i18n-memsource**.
2. Ask: "download translations".
3. Confirm the Memsource project ID (from `state.json` or paste a new one).
4. Skill checks job status, ensures `locales/` is clean, then you (or a shell with
   your token) run download.

### Manual download

```bash
# Auth in YOUR terminal only (same as upload)

PROJECT_ID=...   # from state.json lastProjectId
SPRINT=1         # from state.json

# Require completed jobs before download
# Do not use comma-separated -c (CLI treats it as one column). Prefer no -c,
# or: -c uid -c status -c target_lang
for lang in ja zh-cn ko fr es; do
  echo "=== $lang ==="
  memsource job list \
    --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" \
    --target-lang "$lang" \
    -f json
done
# Proceed only when every job status is COMPLETED / DELIVERED (or equivalent)

# IMPORTANT: check root locales/ (the script checks the wrong paths)
git status --short --untracked-files -- locales/
# must be clean

# Create/switch to the PR branch BEFORE download (script auto-commits).
# Do not use `git switch -C` — that force-resets an existing branch and can
# discard prior translation commits. Only recreate/reset with explicit confirmation.
BRANCH="chore/i18n-update-sprint-${SPRINT}"
git fetch origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$BRANCH"; then
  git switch "$BRANCH"
elif git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$BRANCH"; then
  git switch -c "$BRANCH" --track "origin/$BRANCH"
else
  git switch -c "$BRANCH"
fi

npm run memsource-download -- -p "$PROJECT_ID"
# Review full locale content (not only --stat) before pushing
git diff HEAD~1 -- locales/
git push -u origin HEAD
# open PR as needed
```

---

## Check status only

Ask Cursor: "translation status"  
or:

```bash
for lang in ja zh-cn ko fr es; do
  echo "=== $lang ==="
  memsource job list --project-id PROJECT_ID --target-lang "$lang" -f json
done
```

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | What happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `memsource` not on PATH | `command not found` | `export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"` (or activate the memsource venv) |
| Login without exporting token | 401 `auth: not logged` on whoami/job list | `export MEMSOURCE_TOKEN=$(memsource auth login … -f json \| …)` |
| Comma-separated `-c uid,status,…` | CLI rejects columns as one name | Omit `-c`, or use `-c uid -c status -c target_lang` |
| Skip `zh-cn` symlink on upload | Chinese translations wiped in the Phrase project | Always `ln -sfn zh locales/zh-cn` before export/upload |
| Hand-build POs from English only | Existing ja/ko/fr/es/zh translations lost | Always use `npm run export-pos` |
| Leave English in msgstr | Phrase may treat those strings as already translated | Use current `export-pos` (includes `clear-english-msgstr.js`) |
| Trust download script's git clean check | Uncommitted `locales/` changes get overwritten | Run `git status -- locales/` yourself |
| Download before jobs complete | Incomplete locale overwrite | Check job status first |
| Give Memsource password/token to the agent | Credential exposure | Authenticate only in your shell; never paste tokens into chat |
| Forget to update `state.json` | Next download/status uses stale project ID | Update state after every upload |
| Upload without reviewing `npm run i18n` | Unexpected key churn in locale files | Always review `git diff -- locales/` first |

## After upload: notify localization

Use the draft the skill prints, or:

```text
